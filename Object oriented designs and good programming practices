software design - lower level
software architechture - ouward look of the entire product

how to express these ideas effectively.

Software design converts the wishes of the customer into a design. makes it stable and scalable.
Some don't find a differentiation between software design and architechture.
previous experience helps a lot.

Why important?
stable and long lived system . Basically scalable. you need somebody who looks out for a long game.
the project will fail without some one looking for the long game.

Key challenges?
tradeoff between speed and quality.
understanding the client's problem. in many cases they they themselves don't know.

What's the most important principle?
simplicity first - don't complicate things. simplicity could also be a great solution to a problem.
because - 1) you have pretty much more chances of getting it right.
2) therefore, easy to explain. Knowledge transfer in easier.

what's exciting?
someone always has a problem that is different from the others. Novelty!
